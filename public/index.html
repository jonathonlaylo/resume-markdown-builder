<!-- - View historical data over time for buoys placed all over the world. Select a shark to adopt and give it a name with a $5 donation, and come back often to view where the shark is swimming.
- Visualized and created cluster markers for the buoy and shark data on to Mapbox. Implemented components with React for user information.
- Major outcome from this was project management, team based programming, and self teaching through docs. -->
<ul>
<li>A single page application that shows visualized data of buoys scraped from NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Users see historical data over time for buoys placed all over the world and have the ability to log in and donate via Stripe to “adopt” sharks from live data. Responsibilities in this project were front-end design, React components, and the Mapbox component to visualize buoy data. Dependencies also include Express, React, Leaflet, Redux, Stripe, Rechart, Sequelize, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Mailgun.</li>
