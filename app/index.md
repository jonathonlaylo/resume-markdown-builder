## Development Experience

### Buoy Call
#### [https://buoycall.org/](https://buoycall.org/)

- View historical data over time for buoys placed all over the world. Select a shark to adopt and give it a name with a $5 donation, and come back often to view where the shark is swimming.
- Visualized and created cluster markers for the buoy and shark data on to Mapbox. Implemented components with React for user information.
- Major outcome from this was project management, team based programming, and self teaching through docs.
